## How To Boot Up The App? ü¶ù

For booting up the whole application I have already added `concurrently` modules helps to run `server` and `client` side by side or specifically goes hand by hand from just a **single command**.
The Command to start the app is written down below: -

```bash
# For Product Ready Server
yarn dev

# For Development Server
yarn start
```

- Concurrently Splitted part

```bash
    "scripts": {
        "start": "concurrently -m=3 \"yarn start:backend\" \"&&\" \"yarn start:frontend\"",
        "dev": "concurrently -m=3 \"yarn start:backend\" \"&&\" \"yarn start:frontend\"",
        "start:frontend": "cd frontend && yarn start",
        "start:backend": "cd backend && yarn dev"
    },

```
